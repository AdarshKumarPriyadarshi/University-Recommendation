# University_Recommendation_System


# Background & Objectives of Project:
For an aspiring student who wants to apply for higher studies in other countries, university selection process is a challenging task as lot of different criteria need to considered during application process based on individualâ€™s requirement. This problem can be addressed by modeling a recommender system based on various classification algorithms. In this project based on the student dataset and user profile, a list of 10 best universities will be suggested such that it maximizes the chances of a student getting admission into those universities.

# DataSet:
The first step in building any recommendation system is the identification of the data set. So, the graduate student data was scraped from www.thegradcafe.com and the Undergraduate student data was scraped from https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/. About 271807 rows of raw student data was obtained as a result of web scraping, which is being processed to use as final dataset.
